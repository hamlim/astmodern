# ASTModern

A digital sandbox to experiment building babel plugins.

## Getting Started:

```sh
yarn
```

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Inspiration:

This project is heavily inspired by [astexplorer.net](astexplorer.net). I highly encourage using
that tool if you need something stable, reliable, performant, and for other ASTs / languages.
